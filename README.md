# pride-month-vim
Vim but it's pride month
## Usage
If you have no vimrc, you can just copy the vimrc and `pride-month\*`files into your `$HOME/.vim` folder.
Put the pride month vim script files into your `$HOME/.vim` directory or whereever you please, and then source the `pride-month.vim` file in your vimrc. `pride-month-colors.vim` must be in the same directory as `pride-month.vim`.

The script defines a command, RainbowStop, that will stop the rainbowing and clear the highlights. This does not uninstall the script, and only effects the current vim instance.
